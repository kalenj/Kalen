	<p >Ignorance and prejudice are the handmaidens of propaganda. Our mission, therefore is to confront ignorance with knowledge. Bigotry with outreached hand of generosity. Racism can, will, and must be ended‚Äù - kofi annan
	To me this quote means that in order to fight against racism you must fight through all the effects racism has too. For example if you want to get rid of all the racist thought you must first get rid of all the stereotypes. Then all the people in power you must bring them closer to the ones who arent and lots of other thing so that is what i got from this quote</p>

	<p >Yes because i believe that your race must be in power or more than in order to be racist. But every race can be prejudice, rude, and every race can discriminate.</p>
