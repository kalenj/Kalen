	<p >“We are what we repeatedly do excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit” - Aristotle
	I think this quote means that like nobody is born to who they are it's how they treat themselves and walk around. I could be born very skinny but then if i carry myself around sluggish and not watch my health i can become obese if i make no efforts to staying healthy.</p>

	<p >During our discussion of this topic we talked about things that should be habits in school. One of the things that i chose for things that should be habits is getting to know your study spaces the reason why i chose this one to talk about this one is because i noticed that  it depends on what i am working on or studying because when i am doing math i like louder spaces because it makes me focus more so i remember more and then when i am reading i like quieter spaces.</p>
