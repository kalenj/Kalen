	<p > I like community norms the OK community norms because they keep our space welcoming to everybody so everyone's voice is can be heard and no one is left out. Today we i learned how good it is to make a community. The reason why it is good to make a community is because when you have a community you have people to talk to and people to enjoy time with but when your by yourself u are closed off from everybody else. </p>
