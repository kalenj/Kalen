	<p > Today we had a choice to choose between 2 different quotes but but i really can't pick between the 2 the first one was “It is better to be prepared for a opportunity and not have one than have a opportunity and not be prepared.”
Whitney M. Young
	The other quote was “If you you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready.”
Will Smith
	These quotes are self explanatory because they mean what they say but for example when there is a chance of a hurricane or u live in a place where there are a lot of earthquakes at. you won’t wait until there is an amber alert and then prepare for the earthquake. No your going to always be prepared for the next earthquake so just incase it his close then u dont have to scream and run out your house all crazy because you have and escape system or a safe room or something like that in order for you to survive and do so safely.
