	<p > What we did in the brotherhood chekin wwe basically talked about what we would like to change about the program and what we liked. What I said was that it is hard for me to work on my website if I am not getting enough attention from the teacher for when I need help. It makes it harder to focus when we have to do things in between because all that does is distract me from the project. What i said i liked about the hidden genius project was that i is specifically focuses on black young men, and it teaches us how to prepare for our futures.</p>
