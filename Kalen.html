<h1>All About Me</h1>
<h5><a href="Html/backup.html">Sports Page Project</a></h5>
<h6>My name is Kalen Jackson, I am 14 years old and have 4 different siblings 2 older than me and 2 younger than me. So that means that I am the middle kid of the family. On my moms side since here are only 2 boys me and my brother. I end up doing most of the work because my brother don't like to do thing and he is older and always in the room. Then at my dads I mostly do all the chores because the older ones always complain and the younger ones. Another thing about me is that I have a certification from sports code. Which means I passed the test that proves I have the knowledge to live code a basketball game. This sets me up for a job i would like tohave called a sports data analyst.  Sports data analytics are the people who live code basketball games for coaches like making the stats for passes, or shots made vs shots taken, maybe even turnovers. All those things are at the coaches Request so in this job u don't just do the same thing every time which is something i will enjoy in this job.</h6>
